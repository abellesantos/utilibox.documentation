# Retrying Failed Utilities

This functionality allows EAX Admins to “retry” any Energy Action Exclusive Offers for utilities with failed status, as some may have had issues due to incomplete or incorrect data that has been resolved.

1. From the details page on the top right-hand corner of the table click on the Actions button, select Retry Failed Utilities.
2. A window with the list of failed utilities will appear with the failure reason. User can select all or specific utilities to retry.
3. Click on Retry at the bottom of the list to complete the retry of the utilities selected.
