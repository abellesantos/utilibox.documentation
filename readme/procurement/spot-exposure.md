# Spot Exposure

Managing energy costs becomes risky when parts of your organisation’s usage are not covered by a contract. Any uncovered load is bought at **spot market rates**, which can be highly volatile and unpredictable—making budgets harder to control and increasing financial exposure.

**Utilibox solves this by displaying spot exposure across your organisation.**\
It compares actual usage against your active contracts and highlights any gaps, partial coverage, or expired agreements that push you into buying energy at spot prices. Utilibox clearly shows how much of your load is exposed, when the exposure occurs, and the potential cost impact—helping you act early, close contract gaps, and reduce financial risk.
