# Contracts

Managing multiple energy contracts can be difficult without a clear, centralized view. The Contracts feature solves this by showing all available contracts for your organization and allowing users to easily add, update, or delete them. This keeps contract information organized, accurate, and always up to date.

Table details:

* Company
* Type
* Subtype
* Market Segment
* State(s)
* Retailer
* Agreement #
* Signed Date
* Status
* Start
* End
* Actions

_Contract Status Tracking_

* Future – contract with start date greater than 6 months from current date
* Commencing Soon – contract with start date within 6 months from current date
* Current – contract start and end date is within current date
* Expiring soon – contract with end date within 6 months from current date
* Expired – contract end date is less than current date
