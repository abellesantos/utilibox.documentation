# Portfolio and Sites

Utiliboxâ€™ site page gives customers a simple, single-screen view of all their supply point data, whether it's for electricity, gas, or water, and regardless of the size or metering of the site.

The page also offers access to contract and meter data and even allows customers to look at their recent historical invoices. This makes managing different supply points easier and more straightforward.
