# Dashboard

Energy management doesn’t have to be complicated. Too often, data is scattered, disorganized, and hard to act on—slowing down decisions and driving up costs. Utilibox changes that. It collects your energy data automatically, organizes it into clear insights, and centralizes everything in one intuitive platform. With powerful tools and instant access at your fingertips, Utilibox empowers you to take control, cut through complexity, and make smarter energy decisions with ease.

You need to see an overview of your organization? At a quick glance you'll be able to view:

1. Sites Under Management - shows the number of sites with details of number of supply points and their current status for your organization.
2. Total Amount Due - shows your organization's total bills/amount to be paid from the most recent invoices received for the month.
3. Total Amount Overdue - shows your organization's total missed bills/amount to be paid from previous months invoices.
4. Invoice Completeness - shows your organization's stats of invoices received in the last 12 months.
5. Spend Chart - shows your organization's monthly spend per commodity and broken down per charge based on available invoices with comparison from previous to current calendar year.
6. Emissions Chart - shows your organization's monthly emissions per commodity based on avalable usage data with comparison from previous to current calendar year.
7. For help or advice, your account manager and metrics analyst is a click away to contact.
