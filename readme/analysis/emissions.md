# Emissions

Measuring and tracking emissions can be complex when data is scattered or incomplete. The Emissions page solves this by using invoices processed in Utilibox to let users view and compare current versus previous year emissions. This provides a clear, reliable view of your organization’s environmental impact and supports better sustainability planning.
