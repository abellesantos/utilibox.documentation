# Report History

Keeping track of past reports can be time-consuming when they’re scattered across different sources. The Reports History page solves this by giving you a central list of all reports generated for your organization, with quick access to ‘Run a Report’ when needed. The table view makes it easy to find and review report details, so you always have the right insights at hand.

* Type of the report that was generated
* File Name of the report that was generated
* Download – option to re-download the report
