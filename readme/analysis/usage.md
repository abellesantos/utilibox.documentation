# Usage

Tracking how your organization uses energy over time can be challenging without clear, centralized data. The Usage page solves this by letting users view and compare current versus previous year usage, drawing from meter or invoice data processed in Utilibox. This makes it easy to spot trends, manage efficiency, and reduce waste.
