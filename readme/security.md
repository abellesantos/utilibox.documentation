# Security

_**Two out Three Ain't Bad**_

When it comes to authentication, one out of three factors (password-only) is bad. Multifactor authentication (MFA) on the other hand isn't. Utilibox employs MFA to ensure that the user attempting to login is who they claim to be, so your data doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

_**OLA not BOLA**_

Utilibox has been written ground-up with customer cybersecurity at the forefront of the architecture. We have employed stringent Object Level Authorization design which ensures your security amongst our other secure clients.

_**Australian Privacy Regulations**_

Utilibox adheres to the regulations set forth in the Australian Privacy Act 1988. We implement stringent data protection measures, which include encrypted data storage for sensitive data, secure data transfer practices, and regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance. Our data is stored only within Australian Azure data centers.

_**Energy Action Employees are Cyber-Guardians**_

All Energy Action employees understand that they're integral to our cybersecurity fortress. Energy Action employees undergo regular cybersecurity training and participate in drills to make sure they can detect and respond quickly and effectively in the event of a security incident.
