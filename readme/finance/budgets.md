  against these budgets throughout the year. Clients can also create multiple
  scenarios for analysis.

# Budgets

_Main Data Sources:_

* Latest successfully parsed invoice(s) – doesn’t necessarily mean the invoice from the most recent period, instead the latest invoice available in UB.
* Accruals as substitute for missing actual data from invoices
* Retail Contract Rates
* EAPI – Energy Action price index containing data from past auctions
* Environmental Certificate rates
* Environmental Compliance %
* Network Spend % change per Market Segment (C\&I/SME)
* For Bundled - % cost allocations to unbundled energy spend, network spend and environmental spend

_Estimation Methods:_

* Baseline costs: average of prior invoices
* Baseline and forward usage 1: data from same period of prior year
* Non-bundled electricity energy spend 1 (no contract in place for budget period): data from same period of prior year with applied adjustments based on retail price index movement (when there is no contract)
* Non-bundled network spend: data from same period of prior year with applied adjustments based on network price movement
* Non-bundled network electricity energy spend 2 (contract in place for budget period): estimate based on usage from same period of prior year and contract rates
* Non-bundled electricity energy spend 3 (contract in place for part of budget period only): estimate based on usage from same period of prior year and combination of contract rates and retail price index
* Non-bundled enviro spend 1 (contract in place for part of budget period only): estimate based on usage from same period of prior year and combination of contract rates and certificate price index
* Non-bundled enviro spend 2 (no contract in place for budget period): estimate based on usage from same period of prior year and certificate price index
* Non-bundled other spend: estimate based on usage from same period of prior year and rate from latest invoice
* Bundled energy spend: unbundled estimate from June in prior year data to June in previous year with applied adjustments based on retail price index movement
* Bundled network spend: unbundled estimate from prior year data with applied adjustments based on network price movement
* Bundled enviro spend: unbundled estimate from prior year data with applied adjustments based on certificate price index movement
* Bundled other spend: unbundled estimate from prior year data
* Unbundled estimate from latest invoice
* Import budget: custom calculations – this is the default for imported budget scenarios

_**BASELINE ESTIMATION**_\
&#xNAN;_&#x46;or non-bundled_\
\- actuals/accruals from prior year are used

_For bundled/SME_\
\- bundled spend from prior year and % cost allocations for Energy Spend, Network Spend and       Environmental Spend will be applied. If there are no defined % cost allocations, the followingdefaults will be applied:\
&#x20;              \- 50% for Energy\
&#x20;              \- 40% for Network\
&#x20;              \- 10% for Environmental\


_**BUDGET ESTIMATION**_\
&#xNAN;_&#x45;stimated Energy Spend_\
\- for past or current period – will utilize the latest successfully parsed invoice(s)\
\- for future period and with an active contract for the utility during the budget period

* C\&I – retail spend will come from:
  * Average rate from latest invoice
  * Average rate from contract rates
  * EAPI rates for days not covered by contract
  * Utility’s estimated usage based on prior year
* Bundled/SME
  * Unbundled Energy Spend baseline
  * % change of retail price index (prior period vs budget period)

\- if estimation fails from the above and no market index is available, default to market rates or rates from the last invoice will be utilized

* Electricity C\&I – latest retail price index for the state
* Electricity SME or WA bundled – estimate based on EAPI for the state and rough estimate of 50% energy costs for bundled energy invoices
* Gas – rate from latest invoice multiplied by utility’s estimated usage based on prior year

_Estimated Network Spend_\
\- apply relative network spend changes if applicable, else use data from prior period (same approach for both Electricity, Gas, C\&I and SME)\
\- data reference can be exported in the EAX admin > Networks page

_Estimated Environmental Spend_\
\- for past or current period – will utilize the latest successfully parsed invoice(s)\
\- for future period and with an active contract for the utility during the budget period

* C\&I – environmental spend will come from:
  * Contract Supply Point average rate
  * Latest environmental certificate rate for days not covered by contract
  * Utility’s estimated usage based on prior year
* SME

\- if estimation fails from the above and no market index is available, default to market rates or rates from the last invoice will be utilized

* Electricity C\&I – latest environmental certificate rate for the state
* Electricity SME – 0

_Estimated Other Spend_\
\- sum of prior period’s Adjustments, Market Charges, Metering Charges and Other Charges
