# Invoices | Accruals

Managing finances is difficult when invoices are missing or scattered across billing periods. The Invoices and Accruals page solves this by showing both received and processed invoices, while also estimating any missing periods. This ensures complete and reliable data for financial reports, budgets, procurement, net zero planning, cost-savings analysis, and more.
