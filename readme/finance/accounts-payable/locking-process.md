# Locking Process

This process allows a mandatory review of the AP file details and ability to input notes by the analyst

1. Click the “View Details” button
2. Select invoices for submission then click “Lock” at the top right corner of the page
3. Scenario 1: If all invoices are selected, there will be a simple confirmation pop-up before locking. Scenario 2: If there are excluded invoices, there will be a different confirmation process which requires the Analyst to explicitly state the reasons for exclusion.
4. Once locked, the page will indicate that the report is locked and there will be key stats per invoice type (e.g. 10 of 15 locked for submission). There is still an option to unlock the report if needed. Any excluded invoices will have a slightly different styling and there will be warning icons in the Amount column. The warning icon can be hovered to see the reason.

> _\*Unlocking Process - this process allows to include additional invoices by a metrics analyst to a locked report by clicking on the “Unlock” button._
