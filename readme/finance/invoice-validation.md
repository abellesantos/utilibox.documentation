# Invoice Validation

Invoices often contain errors—whether from incorrect charges, mismatched meter data, or overlooked contract terms—and these mistakes can cost businesses significantly over time. Utilibox’s Invoice Validation feature solves this by automatically reviewing invoices against contracts, meter data, and expected charges. This ensures accuracy, highlights discrepancies, and gives you confidence that every payment is correct, saving both money and administrative effort.
