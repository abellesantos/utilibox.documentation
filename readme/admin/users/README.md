# Users

Managing user access across an organization can be challenging without a clear system. The Users page solves this by giving admin users a central place to view, add, edit, or remove users. With detailed information on each account, admins can keep access secure and ensure the right people have the right permissions.

* Email – shows email address used to register a user
* User status – seen beside the email address to indicate the following which may require further action
* Last Login – shows date of latest login attempt for the user
* Role – identifies which level of access is provided for the user (can only assign 1 per user)
* Organisation – lists the available companies a user has access to (can be multiple organisations for specific roles)
*   Full Access – a checkbox that allows users to activate/deactivate full access to specified organisation.

    * deactivate full access
    * activate full access – note that full access deactivates ability to choose organisation

    \*Change will only apply once you click on the save button
* Actions – allows the following administrative actions for the user
  * Save profile - When successfully saved, a notification will show at the top of the screen
  * More actions to manage account
    * Resend account activation
    * Reset user authentication
    * Request password reset
    * Delete user
