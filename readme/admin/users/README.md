# Users

Managing user access across an organization can be challenging without a clear system. The Users page solves this by giving admin users a central place to view, add, edit, or remove users. With detailed information on each account, admins can keep access secure and ensure the right people have the right permissions.

* Email – shows email address used to register a user
* User status – seen beside the email address to indicate the following which may require further action
* Last Login – shows date of latest login attempt for the user
*   Role – identifies which level of access is provided for the user (can only assign 1 per user)

    Highest to lowest permission level:

    * EAX-Admin
      * Has access to all organisations in Utilibox (this includes all the data tied to each organisation)
      * Has access to all EAX sections in Utilibox
    * EAX-User
      * Currently has no distinction from EAX-Admins but there are plans to add more difference in security settings in the future
    * Channel-Partner
      * Has access to selected organisations in Utilibox (this will only include the data tied to the selected organisation)
      * Does not have access to Reference Data, Meter Data, and Admin sections in EAX mode
    * Company-Admin
      * Has full access to only one organisation in Utilibox
    * Company-User
      * Similar to Company-Admins but will have some limited permission
      * Permissions not allowed:
        * Viewing of users under organisation
        * Inviting new users
        * Limiting access of other users to specific companies under the organisation

*   Full Access – a checkbox that allows users to activate/deactivate full access to specified organisation.
