# Mailbox

Handling emails from market participants can be overwhelming, especially when invoices and notifications arrive from multiple sources. The Mailbox page solves this by centralizing all incoming emails within Utilibox, where supplier invoices are automatically loaded and processed for payment reporting. Non-invoice messages can be routed by rules, forwarded to the right recipients, or grouped for easier management—ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

* Inbox – shows emails received
* Forwarded – shows emails forwarded as configured for the organisation
* Sync Emails – this button manually syncs emails
* Configuration – this allows setup/update of the mailbox settings
  * Mailbox – shows the email address for the organisation and is automatically created upon organisation creation with a standard naming convention of \<organisation name>@mail.utilibox.tech
  * Change Mailbox Name – this is only available for organisations with suffixes on their names that can be removed from the email address (eg. “incorporated", " inc", " proprietary", " pty", " limited", " ltd")
  * \+ Add Forwarding Route
